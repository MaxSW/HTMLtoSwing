# HTMLtoSwing
HTML &amp; CSS to Swing

This project is a work in progress. At the moment, only certain HTML elements, CSS selectors and CSS styles are parsed.
However, the basic parsing engine is complete. This means that I will be adding the other HTML and CSS features quite quickly.
For an example of the library, see [Test](https://github.com/MaxSW/HTMLtoSwing/blob/master/src/com/xwarner/html/Test.java).

This library uses the brilliant [TableLayout](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/tablelayout/) library to arrange the Swing components.
